# cgol

An Arduino program that simulates Conway's Game of Life on a 16x16 LED grid using an Arduino-compatible board. 
The simulation showcases the emergence of patterns and life-like behaviors based on simple cellular automaton rules.
The rules are as follows:

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

I am using a Seeed Xiao M0 dev board for this project. It should work on any Arduino compatible board with enough pins and at least 2 interrupt pins.


## Usage

Turn the encoder to access different pages. Defaults to page 1 on boot which is a simple glider. The pages are as follows:
- page 0 -- generates a random grid and runs the simulation. If the simulation becomes periodic, it generates a new grid after a few seconds
- pages 1-3 -- pre-loaded grids. Can be changed in the code by changing binary data in p1, p2, and p3 arrays
- pages 4-6 -- grids saved from page 0

Encoder button:
- when on page 0, pressing the button saves the initial random grid of the current simulation to page 4, 5, or 6, cycling through
- when on any other page, pressing the button will go to page 0, generating a new grid
- if button is held, potentiometer will control brightness

Potentiometer:
- controls the speed of the simulation
- controls brightness while the encoder button is held
