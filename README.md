# cgol

An Arduino program that simulates Conway's Game of Life on a 16x16 LED grid using an Arduino board. 
The simulation showcases the emergence of patterns and life-like behaviors based on simple cellular automaton rules.
The rules are as follows:

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
